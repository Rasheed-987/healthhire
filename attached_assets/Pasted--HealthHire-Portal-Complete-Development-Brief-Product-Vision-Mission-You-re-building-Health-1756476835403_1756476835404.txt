# HealthHire Portal - Complete Development Brief

## Product Vision & Mission
You're building HealthHire Portal, a comprehensive career toolkit that transforms healthcare job hunting from scattered, manual processes into a guided, intelligent journey. This isn't just another job board—it's a complete career acceleration platform specifically designed for overseas healthcare professionals, UK care workers transitioning to NHS roles, and health/science graduates.

**Core Value Proposition**: Take someone from "who am I and what fits me?" all the way to "offer accepted" through AI-powered personalization, NHS-specific expertise, and gamified engagement.

## Target Users & Pain Points

### Primary Audiences:
1. **Overseas Healthcare Professionals** - Need visa guidance, UK workplace culture understanding, credential translation
2. **UK Care Workers → NHS Transition** - Require band progression knowledge, Supporting Information expertise
3. **New Health/Science Graduates** - Need career direction, interview confidence, application optimization

### Pain Points You're Solving:
- NHS applications are uniquely complex (Supporting Information, person specs, values alignment)
- Generic CVs fail in healthcare settings that need evidence-based, measurable outcomes
- Interview prep lacks NHS-specific values focus and clinical scenario practice
- Job tracking across multiple trusts is fragmented and overwhelming
- Visa/registration requirements create eligibility confusion

## Technical Architecture Principles

### Stack Recommendations:
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for rich interactivity and dashboard complexity
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI for AI integration capabilities
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational job/profile data + Redis for caching
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude for document generation + embeddings for job matching
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar for document uploads (CVs, certificates)
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or similar for robust user management
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)

### Data Architecture:
- **User Profiles**: Nested JSON for complex healthcare qualifications (GMC/NMC/HCPC numbers, specialties, band preferences)
- **Job Matching**: Vector embeddings for role fit scoring
- **STAR Examples**: Structured storage for reusable interview/application content
- **Document Versioning**: Track iterations of CVs/Supporting Info with change history
- **Analytics**: Event tracking for user journey optimization
