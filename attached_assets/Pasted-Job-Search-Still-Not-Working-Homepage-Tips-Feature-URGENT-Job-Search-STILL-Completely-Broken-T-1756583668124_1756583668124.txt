Job Search Still Not Working + Homepage Tips Feature
🚨 URGENT: Job Search STILL Completely Broken
The job search feature is still not working at all. Users still cannot:

Search for any jobs (returns no results)
View job details (buttons don't work)
See role fit scores (not calculating)
Access any real NHS job data

This needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY - the platform is unusable without working job search.
Please implement the web scraping and job search functionality as outlined in the previous message. Until this works, users cannot use the core features of HealthHire Portal.

NEW FEATURE: Rotating Tips on Homepage Dashboard
Add a rotating tip section above the main dashboard that shows helpful NHS application advice
Implementation Requirements:
Tip Display Box:

Position: Above the 7 section cards on main dashboard
Style: Attractive banner/card with light background
Icon: 💡 or similar tip icon
Rotation: Changes every time user visits or refreshes page
Dismissible: Users can close it but it returns next session

Implementation Code:
javascript// Homepage tip component
const RotatingTip = () => {
  const [currentTip, setCurrentTip] = useState('');
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Select random tip on component mount
    const randomTip = healthHireTips[Math.floor(Math.random() * healthHireTips.length)];
    setCurrentTip(randomTip);
  }, []);

  if (!isVisible) return null;

  return (
    <div className="rotating-tip mb-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
          <span className="text-2xl">💡</span>
          <p className="text-blue-800 font-medium">{currentTip}</p>
        </div>
        <button 
          onClick={() => setIsVisible(false)}
          className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600"
        >
          ✕
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

// Add to main dashboard
const Dashboard = () => {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <RotatingTip />  {/* Add this above the section cards */}
      
      <div className="section-cards-grid">
        {/* Your 7 section cards here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
Tip Rotation Logic:

Random selection: Different tip each time user visits homepage
Session memory: Same tip shown until user leaves and returns
Dismissible: User can close tip but it returns next session
Mobile friendly: Responsive design that works on all devices

Visual Design:

Light blue background with darker blue text (NHS colors)
Lightbulb icon to indicate helpful tip
Clean typography that's easy to read
Subtle shadow to make it stand out from main content
Close button (X) in top right corner

This will provide continuous value to users by showing them expert NHS application advice every time they visit the platform, helping them improve their chances of success while using HealthHire Portal.
PRIORITY: Fix the job search functionality first, then add the tips feature!
