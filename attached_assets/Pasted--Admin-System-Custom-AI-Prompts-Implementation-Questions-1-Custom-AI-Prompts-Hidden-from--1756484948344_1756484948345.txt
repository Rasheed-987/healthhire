# Admin System & Custom AI Prompts - Implementation Questions

## 1. Custom AI Prompts (Hidden from Users)

**We need to create custom prompts for ChatGPT/AI generation that users never see**

### Requirements:
- **CV Generation**: Custom prompts that understand NHS format, healthcare terminology, STAR methodology
- **Supporting Information**: Prompts that map to NHS person specifications and values
- **Interview Q&A**: Role-specific prompts that generate NHS-style questions
- **Henry's Responses**: Knowledge base prompts for the chatbot assistant

### Questions for You:
1. **How can we store custom AI prompts** that are completely hidden from users?
2. **Can we create a prompt management system** where we can edit/update prompts without code changes?
3. **How do we inject user data** (profile, job description) into these hidden prompts?
4. **What's the best way to version control prompts** so we can test improvements?

### Example Implementation Needed:
```javascript
// Hidden prompt templates
const hiddenPrompts = {
  cvGeneration: `
    You are an expert NHS recruitment specialist. Generate a 2-page CV for a healthcare professional applying to NHS roles.
    
    RULES:
    - Use UK spelling and NHS terminology
    - Format with clear sections: Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Certifications
    - Include measurable outcomes using STAR methodology
    - Match tone to: {USER_EXPERIENCE_LEVEL}
    - Target band level: {TARGET_BAND}
    
    USER DATA:
    {USER_PROFILE}
    
    JOB REQUIREMENTS:
    {JOB_DESCRIPTION}
    
    Generate professional CV content now:
  `,
  
  supportingInfo: `
    Create NHS Supporting Information (900-1200 words) that directly addresses person specification...
    [USERS NEVER SEE THIS PROMPT]
  `
};
```

## 2. Admin Dashboard & Platform Management

**We need a comprehensive admin system to manage the entire platform**

### Admin Dashboard Requirements:

#### User Management:
- **View all users**: Search, filter by subscription status, registration date
- **User details**: Profile completion, payment history, usage stats
- **Subscription management**: Manually upgrade/downgrade users, extend access
- **Support tickets**: View Henry escalations, user messages, response tracking

#### Content Management System (CMS):
- **Job listings**: Manually add/edit NHS jobs, mark as featured/sponsored
- **Resources hub**: Upload guides, checklists, mini-courses, CPD materials  
- **Templates**: Edit CV/Supporting Information templates and examples
- **FAQ management**: Update Henry's knowledge base responses

#### Platform Analytics:
- **User journey tracking**: Where users drop off, most used features
- **Conversion metrics**: Free-to-paid conversion rates, feature usage
- **AI generation stats**: Most generated documents, success rates
- **Performance monitoring**: Page load times, error rates, uptime

#### AI/Prompt Management:
- **Prompt editor**: Modify AI generation prompts without coding
- **A/B testing**: Test different prompt versions for better outputs
- **Quality monitoring**: Review generated content quality, user feedback
- **Henry training**: Update chatbot responses, add new knowledge areas

### Questions for You:

1. **How can we build an admin dashboard** that's separate from the main user interface?
2. **What's the best way to implement role-based access** (super admin, content admin, support admin)?
3. **Can we create a CMS for non-technical team members** to manage content?
4. **How do we track and log all admin actions** for security/audit purposes?

### Admin Dashboard Structure:
```
/admin (protected route)
├── /dashboard (overview stats)
├── /users (user management)
├── /content (CMS for resources)  
├── /prompts (AI prompt editor)
├── /analytics (platform metrics)
├── /support (Henry tickets)
├── /settings (platform config)
└── /logs (admin activity)
```

## 3. Henry the Helper Training System

**We need to continuously improve Henry's responses and knowledge**

### Henry Training Requirements:

#### Knowledge Base Management:
- **Add new responses**: For common user questions
- **Edit existing responses**: Improve clarity and helpfulness  
- **Category management**: Organize by topic (payment, technical, NHS guidance)
- **Response testing**: Preview how Henry will respond before going live

#### Learning from Interactions:
- **Conversation logging**: Track what users ask Henry
- **Escalation analysis**: Why did conversations escalate to human support?
- **Response effectiveness**: Did Henry's answer solve the user's problem?
- **Common question identification**: Auto-suggest new responses needed

#### Admin Training Interface:
```javascript
// Henry admin training panel
const HenryAdmin = () => {
  return (
    <div className="henry-training">
      <section className="knowledge-base">
        <h2>Henry's Knowledge Base</h2>
        <button>Add New Response</button>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>User Question Pattern</th>
            <th>Henry's Response</th>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Success Rate</th>
            <th>Actions</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>"how much cost"</td>
            <td>"£70 lifetime access..."</td>
            <td>Pricing</td>
            <td>94%</td>
            <td>Edit | Test | Delete</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
      
      <section className="recent-escalations">
        <h2>Recent Escalations to Human Support</h2>
        {/* List conversations Henry couldn't handle */}
      </section>
      
      <section className="response-tester">
        <h2>Test Henry's Response</h2>
        <input placeholder="Type a user question..." />
        <button>See Henry's Response</button>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Questions for You:

1. **How can we create a training interface** for non-technical team members to improve Henry?
2. **Can we implement machine learning** to improve Henry's responses over time?
3. **How do we handle sensitive/complex questions** that Henry shouldn't attempt to answer?
4. **What's the best way to organize Henry's knowledge base** for easy management?

## Implementation Priority:

### Phase 1: Basic Admin System
- Admin login/authentication
- User management dashboard
- Basic prompt editing interface

### Phase 2: Content Management
- Resources upload system
- Job management interface  
- Henry knowledge base editor

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics  
- User journey tracking
- AI generation monitoring
- Performance dashboards

### Phase 4: Machine Learning Integration
- Automated Henry improvements
- Predictive user behavior
- Advanced prompt optimization

## Security Considerations:

- **Admin access control**: Strong authentication, IP restrictions if needed
- **Audit logging**: Track all admin changes with timestamps and user IDs  
- **Data protection**: Ensure admin can't access user's private documents
- **Prompt security**: Hidden prompts never exposed in frontend code
- **Role separation**: Different admin levels (content, support, super admin)

Can you help us implement these admin capabilities and hidden prompt systems?
