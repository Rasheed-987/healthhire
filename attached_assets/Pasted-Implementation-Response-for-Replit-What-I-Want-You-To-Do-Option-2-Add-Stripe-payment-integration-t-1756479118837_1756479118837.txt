Implementation Response for Replit
What I Want You To Do:
Option 2: Add Stripe payment integration to the existing Replit Auth system
Keep the current Replit Auth (it's working fine) and add the payment/freemium layer on top of it. This is the most practical approach that builds on what's already working.
Implementation Priority (Do in this order):
Phase 1: Add User Payment Status to Database
sql-- Add these columns to existing users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscription_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'free';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN payment_date TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN free_tier_limits JSONB DEFAULT '{"jobs_viewed_today": 0, "last_reset": "2024-01-01"}';
Phase 2: Implement Basic Feature Gates

Add middleware/hooks to check user.subscription_status
Show "Upgrade to unlock" overlays on premium features for free users
Allow free users to see 5 jobs per day (with counter reset)
Block AI generation, interview practice, job tracking for free users

Phase 3: Add Stripe Payment Flow

Set up Stripe Checkout for £70 one-time payment
Create /api/payments/create-checkout endpoint
Add webhook handler at /api/webhooks/stripe to upgrade users after payment
Create upgrade prompts throughout the app

Phase 4: Polish the Free Experience

Create compelling upgrade moments
Show sample/demo content for premium features
Add upgrade CTAs in strategic locations

Start with Stripe test mode - I'll provide live credentials later. Use these test values:

Add upgrade prompts at key friction points
Test payment flow thoroughly in test mode

Questions for You:

Should I create a dedicated /pricing page?
Where should the main "Upgrade" button be placed?
Do you want email receipts sent after payment?
Should I add a "Manage Account" page for paid users?
