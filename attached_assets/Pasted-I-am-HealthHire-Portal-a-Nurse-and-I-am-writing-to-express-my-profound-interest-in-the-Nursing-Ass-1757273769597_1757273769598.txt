I am HealthHire Portal, a Nurse, and I am writing to express my profound interest in the Nursing Associate Band 4 position on the Hyper-Acute Stroke Unit at York Hospital. Having followed the remarkable developments in stroke care over the years, I am incredibly drawn to the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, multi-disciplinary team that treats stroke as the medical emergency it is. Your Trust's values of being kind, open, and pursuing excellence resonate deeply with my own professional and personal principles, and I am confident that my skills and experience align perfectly with the requirements of this role.

My journey in healthcare began with my role as a Healthcare Assistant at Imran Khan, a position I have held since December 2013. This long-term experience has been the bedrock of my career, teaching me the fundamental importance of patient-centred care. I have spent years assisting patients with their daily living activities, always prioritising their dignity and respect. This has given me a deep appreciation for the challenges patients face, particularly those who have lost a degree of independence, which is often the case for individuals recovering from a stroke. In this role, I have also supported qualified nurses with a range of clinical tasks and patient monitoring. This taught me to be observant, meticulous, and to understand the vital signs and subtle changes that can indicate a patient's deteriorating condition. I also learned the importance of effective and empathetic communication, not just with patients but also with their families, who are often anxious and in need of reassurance and clear information. This direct experience has prepared me to communicate compassionately and appropriately, a key responsibility outlined in your job description.

Building on this solid foundation, my experience as a Nurse at NHS Scotland from February 2025 has allowed me to take on greater responsibility and further develop my clinical skills. I have been responsible for providing comprehensive patient care across various medical wards, which has given me a broad understanding of managing complex health conditions. A significant part of my role involved safely administering medications and meticulously monitoring patient responses to treatments. I understand that in a hyper-acute stroke setting, where "time is brain," this skill is absolutely critical. My practice is always evidence-based, ensuring that I provide the safest and most effective care possible. I am accustomed to maintaining accurate and contemporaneous patient records in line with NHS standards, and I am proficient in using electronic systems to update care plans and risk assessments, a core duty for the Nursing Associate role. Furthermore, my role as a Nurse has involved extensive collaboration with multidisciplinary teams to develop and implement holistic care plans. I actively participate in team meetings and board rounds, contributing my insights to ensure that our patients receive coordinated and patient-centred interventions, which aligns with the team-focused approach of your stroke service.

My academic background has provided me with the theoretical knowledge to underpin my practical skills. I will be completing my Degree Nursing from Manchester in 2025. This course has equipped me with a thorough understanding of human anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology, as well as the principles of evidence-based practice and critical thinking. This education ensures that I not only know how to perform a task but also understand the reasoning behind it, which is essential for delivering high-quality care and contributing to service improvement. I am eager to apply this knowledge within your innovative stroke service and to continue my professional development through the educational package and competency framework you offer.

I have also actively sought to enhance my skills through further training. I have completed a course in BLS (BLS, Completed) and another in Life Support (Shush, Completed). These certifications mean I am prepared to respond effectively in an emergency, a vital skill in a hyper-acute environment where a patient's condition can change rapidly. Additionally, my Community Care (eHealth UK, Completed) course has given me valuable insight into the entire patient pathway, from hospital admission through to discharge and care in the community. Understanding this full journey is crucial for effective discharge planning and ensuring continuity of care for stroke patients, helping to facilitate a smoother transition back to their homes.

The core skills listed in my profile are central to my nursing practice. My caring attitude is something I demonstrate every day. It means I see the person, not just the patient, and I am committed to providing the kind of compassionate care I would want for my own family. This directly reflects your Trust's value of being kind. I believe this is especially important when caring for stroke patients and their families, who are navigating a life-altering event. I am also a highly productive individual. I thrive in busy environments like a ward and can effectively manage my time and prioritise tasks to ensure all my responsibilities are met to the highest standard, contributing to the team's pursuit of excellence. Finally, I am naturally proactive. I do not wait to be told what to do; I anticipate the needs of my patients and the team. I actively look for ways to improve care processes and am always open to new ideas and learning opportunities, reflecting the value of being open. I believe this proactive nature will allow me to contribute positively to the continuous improvement culture of your stroke service, as measured by the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. I am truly enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing my experience, skills, and dedication to the Hyper-Acute Stroke Unit at York Hospital and contributing to your team's success in delivering outstanding patient care.
