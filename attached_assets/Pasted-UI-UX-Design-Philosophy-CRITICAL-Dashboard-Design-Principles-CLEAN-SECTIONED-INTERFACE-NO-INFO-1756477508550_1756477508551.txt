UI/UX Design Philosophy - CRITICAL
Dashboard Design Principles:
CLEAN, SECTIONED INTERFACE - NO INFORMATION OVERLOAD
The main dashboard should be a clean, card-based layout with 7 distinct sections. Each section is a clickable card that reveals its features only when selected. Think Netflix categories or Notion workspace blocks.
Main Dashboard Layout:
Header: HealthHire Portal + User Avatar + Progress Ring
Main Content: 7 Large, Clean Section Cards (2x4 grid or 3x3)
Footer: Quick stats + Support
The 7 Core Sections (Each as a Distinct Navigation Area):
Section 1: "Candidate Profile"
Card Preview: Profile completion % + "Complete Your Profile"
Click to reveal: Profile wizard, evidence locker, STAR builder, values assessment
Section 2: "Job Finder"
Card Preview: "X new matches" + Search bar preview
Click to reveal: Smart filters, saved searches, role fit scoring, pay calculator
Section 3: "Application Documents"
Card Preview: "Generate tailored applications" + Quick CV/Supporting Info buttons
Click to reveal: CV generator, Supporting Information generator, cover letters, version control
Section 4: "Resources Hub"
Card Preview: "Learn & Prepare" + Featured resource
Click to reveal: NHS guides, checklists, mini-courses, CPD tracking
Section 5: "Interview Practice"
Card Preview: "Practice makes perfect" + Last practice score
Click to reveal: Mock interviews, feedback engine, practice history, improvement tracking
Section 6: "Q&A Generator"
Card Preview: "Get interview-ready" + Generate questions button
Click to reveal: Role-specific question generation, model answers, practice planner
Section 7: "Job Tracker & Analytics"
Card Preview: "X applications in progress" + Success rate %
Click to reveal: Kanban board, application cards, KPIs, motivational dashboard
Navigation Behavior:

Main Dashboard: Clean overview with section cards
Section Pages: Deep dive into that section's tools with breadcrumb back to main
Within Sections: Sub-navigation tabs if needed, but keep it minimal
Cross-Section Links: Smart suggestions (e.g., "Generate Supporting Info for this job" from Job Finder)

Visual Design Requirements:

Whitespace-heavy: Breathing room between elements
Card-based: Each section and feature in defined containers
Progressive disclosure: Show basics first, reveal complexity on demand
Clear hierarchy: Main → Section → Feature → Tool
Minimal cognitive load: One primary action per screen
