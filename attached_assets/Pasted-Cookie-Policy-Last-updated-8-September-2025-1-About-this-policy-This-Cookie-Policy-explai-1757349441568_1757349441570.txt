Cookie Policy

Last updated: 8 September 2025

1) About this policy

This Cookie Policy explains how HealthHire Portal / HealthHire UK (“we”, “us”) uses cookies and similar technologies on our website and app. For how we handle personal data more generally, see our Privacy Notice.

2) What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. They help a site work, remember your preferences, and understand how people use it. We also use similar technologies such as local storage and pixels—together referred to here as “cookies”.

3) How we use cookies

We use cookies for the following purposes:

Essential (strictly necessary): required to run the site, keep you signed in, secure your account, process payments, and deliver core features. These run on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing a secure, functional service and do not require consent.

Preferences: remember choices like language or display settings.

Analytics: help us understand usage (pages visited, features used) so we can improve performance and user experience.

(Optional) Marketing/Attribution: if enabled, measure the effectiveness of our campaigns and referrals.

We only set non-essential cookies (Preferences, Analytics, Marketing) with your consent.

4) Your choices

Cookie banner: On your first visit you can Accept all, Reject all (for non-essential), or Manage settings by category.

Change your mind anytime: Use the privacy link in the support centre to update your choices or withdraw consent.

Browser controls: You can block or delete cookies via your browser settings. Blocking essential cookies may break parts of the site.

Quick link: Cookie settings (opens the preferences manager)

🔷 Replace or remove providers you don’t use. If you add any new vendors (e.g., live chat, error monitoring), include them here.

6) Local storage & similar tech

We may use local storage to cache non-sensitive settings (e.g., UI preferences) and server-side sessions to keep you signed in. We treat these similarly to cookies in terms of consent where they’re not strictly necessary.

7) Third-party cookies

Some features (e.g., payments via Stripe, embedded content, or analytics) are provided by third parties who may set their own cookies. We control which categories are loaded and seek your consent where required, but those providers control how their cookies are used. Please review their policies for details.

8) Changes to this policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We’ll post the latest version here and update the “Last updated” date.
